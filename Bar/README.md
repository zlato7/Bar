Bar

The bar starts with 200lv.
Employees: bartender, chef, security, waiter, band
Clients
Menu: product, size and price. There are drinks and dishes (every dish has a recipe)

When the program starts it opens a window for choosing a day of the week.
Monday and Tuesday the bar is off.
Friday and Saturday there is a band that plays. If you chose one of those days there will have 10lv entrance and the music play. 
The band is only one but they play tributes that are randomly generated. 
Some employees work only on Friday and Saturday - members of the band and the security man.

Once you choose a day and press ok you will see first the menu, after that the day of the week is printed and the tribute if any.
We have randomly generated customers - up to 100. And randomly make the people in groups of up to 6.
We have 10 tables and each table is for up to 6 people.
If we have more than 10 groups of people - the first 10 groups settle in and the others wait for a free table. 
At random we choose a waiter for the current table, each client could choose up to 5 things from the menu (also random). 
If the current product from the menu is available we print the name and print that it's ready, 
if it's over we print "No more" and the name of the product. Half of the clients give 10% tips to the waiter.
We print the daily turnover and the daily wage of each employee(for waitresses we print the tips also). 
If there is a band for the day - we print all money from the tickets, band honorarium(half of the money from tickets) 
and the money for each band member.
We print all orders and the bill of each client, most ordered and least ordered products from the menu. 
We remove the least ordered products from the menu and print the menu again. Prints all products left.
